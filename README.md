### Book influence you
*Talk about a book you have read that was important to you for some reason. Explain why the book was important to you. Give specific details and examples to explain your answer.*

The book that is of much importance to me is the **Wonderful Advantures of Nil**, which talks about a boy named Nil travelling around the world with gooses. This book is important to me because it is the first fairy tale I've read. I still remember that I stay up all night reading this book. It is also because Nil taught me a lot. He taught me that I need to stay calm while facing a problem. Along the journey travelling the world, Nil encountered a lot of dangerous situation, being chased by a wolf, for example. But instead of being nervious, Nils always stay calm and think how to get rid of it, and he always succeed eventually. His way of solving problem helps a lot when I sometimes run into real problems.

### television
*Some people believe that television has had a positive influence on society. Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.*

In my opinion, the television has a positive influence on society. The reason are tow folds. On one hand, it is a good way to kill time. Whenever you are tired or feel boring, you can turn on your television, switch to an insteresting programmme, and enjoy watching it. It makes our life more interesting. On the other hand, while you are killing your time, you can also get access to more information or news using TV. When I was young, I often watch a programme called **Exploring**, in which I learnt a lot of knowledge outside classroom. For example, the unknown questions in the world, the different kinds of weather and how they are formed, etc.

### Centerville College News

In the letter, Paul is opposed to building new sculptures. He thinks that it will be too cost for their poor school, and it will take a lot of area where is the green open area for student to rest. But the woman do not agree with Paul. First, she point out that the finance of building new sculptures are supported by anonymous donor, who she is grateful of. Second, she thinks that Paul's second reason is for himself, because he always play footballs with his friend on that place. If the sculpture is done, he need to find another place.

### GroupThink

Groupthink is a phenomenon that, when people make decisions as a group, they always make one that against his own will because of pressure, which is always bad or irrational. In the speaking, the professor use his company's experience to explain it. Once, he, his boss and coworker thought that an up-to-date looking will help selling their product, so they made a meeting about it. At first, more than half of the workers agree with him, until a senior professor said that they need to focus on technique, no the apperance. Suddenly almost all the workers changed their mind, including his coworker. So this idea was abandoned. At last, their competitors chose to focus on the apperance, which result a big loss to their company.

### Cars or Public transportations

Mary is a volunteer of the after school's elementary school, and they plan to have a trip recently. At the beginning, she want to borrow a van as a transportation. But there is no van available for her. There are two solutions. First, she can choose to borrow cars from her friend, but by doing so, she need to borrow and to look for another drivers. She can also choose to use public transportations, but by doing so, she will have trouble supervising the childrens. I prefer the second choice, because it is more efficient, and do not need to worry about drivers. I also think that supervising childrens will improve one's managing skills.

### Experiments on baby's Math ability

Scientists learned that a baby as young as 5 month's old will have the basic arithmatic ability, such as 1 plus 1 is two. The experiments goes like this. First, they put a doll on the table in front of the baby. Then they down the screen so that it can not be seen. Then they put aonther dolls on the table, the baby now know that there should be 2 dolls behind the screen. But the scientist remove one secretly. When they roll up the sreen, the baby is surprised that there is only one doll on the table because they are staring at it! This experiment proves that even baby will have the basic arithmatic ability.

### Recommend city to a foreign friend

I would recommend my friend to the city of my university - Shang Hai. There are two main reasons. First, Shanghai is the most international city in my country. It has a lot of universities like mine, which consist of a considerable number of foreign students. Besides university, Shang Hai also have a lot of companies that have a lot of foreign workers. A more international city will provide a more pleasant atmosphere, in my point of view. Second, Shang Hai also has a plenty of places of interests. For example, the Shang Hai Bond, Tianzi Fang. There are also free libraries and parks for visitors to play around. It is really a good place to fufill one's life even for local people.

### Course cancellation

The school want to cancel the sculpture cources in art department because of the lack of student and the retirement of the only-one professor who teaches the cource. The woman thinks that is a bot loss towards the school. First, the lack of student is not a result of a lack of interests, but a lack of time. The students there have a lot of requirement. Their time is spend mostly on the struggling of meeting the requirements, so there is little time to choose a course like scupture class. Second, if the money matters, a part-time professor is a good choice, and there are a lot of teachers who has a second interested area, which includes sculptures. So the lack of teacher is not a problem

### Types of book you like

I like the story books most, especially the fairy tales. The reasons are two folds. First, it is very interesting. I remember when I was young, I like reading a book named The Wonderful Advanture of Nils, which is a fairy tale about travelling. I was so obsessed by this book that I spent one whole night finish reading it. The stories in this kind of book is always full of fun and astonishment. Second, the book is always imaginary, which means that we can experience what we can't do in real life in this kinds of books, which can make our life more interesting and meet our imaginary eagers.

### How to make friends

I think the best we to make friends is to work with them. Work will provide us a more formal way to communicate with each other, and thus will provide more chance to be familiar with each other. If I work with friends, I will not have to worry about what to talk about when we are together, which will reduce chance of getting into embarrassment. And work also provide us more chance to do things out of work. For example, if we work together all day long, we can eat together and relax together, which will in return help building a stronger friendship between us.

### Learn from the past

I totally agree that we should always remember and learn from the past. As the saying goes, the failure is the mother of the success, in other words. It is only by learnning from the past experience of failures can we succeed eventually. It is important because the mistake we have done told us what is wrong and what is right. For example, when I was very young, I drag out 100 yuans from my parents pocket to get a toy I liked best in the shop. I was too young to know that spending money without permission is wrong. Of course I got taught baddly from my father. Since then, I always ask for permission first to spend my parents money.

### A Special Opportunity

The special opportunity was given to me recently is an interview of Microsoft. This is very important to me because it provide me with an opprotunity of working at Microsoft as an intern. I can do some research I like during this internship, which is also a good experience. I can even get a better graduate school because of it. It is also special because it can help improve my ability of self-living and self-motivating. I need to take care of myself there, all of the daily things should be taken care of by me, so it is also a great opprotunity build up my self.

### Cell phone in Classroom

I total agree that students should not allowed to take cellphones into classrooms. The reasons are two folds. On the one hand, cell phone will distract students from studying. For example, in my high school class, the students who take cellphones with them always performed worse in the exam. Which means that they spend a lot of money on cell phones, not on studying. On the other hand, using of cell phone also do harm to the student around users. The students around the person who use the cellphone will also get distressed. So it will do no good for either themselves or their friends.

### Jobs

The job that I want to have most is to be a programmer. There are two reasons. First, I think coding and programming is so cool. You can let a machine do things that people can't do just by doing some codings.  I really love coding with computers. Second, programmer is more like a inventer to me. I mean, you can create something new, something high in technology with only coding on computers. The programs created can facilate and fufill our life, which is so great.

### Spend moneny

If I get an unexpected large amount of money, I will spend it on practical things. In my opinion, if we only spend money on our pleasure, it is a waste of money. If we spend on practical things, the value of the money will be exploited fully. Because practical things will always last longer than pleasure. It is always there whenever we want to use it. So it will be more valuable. 

### Types of books

The type of books I like to read most is the fairy tales. The reasons are two folds. First, most books of this type are very interesting, for example, my favorate book *The Wonderful Advantures of Nils* tells a story about a person named Nils travelling around the words. The stories and scenes descripted in this book are fanscinating. Second, most of them are imaginary, which can open our eyes and fufill our lifes. Reading these books can provide us with the experiences could not appear in real, so it is very meanningful for us to read this kind of books.

### Different life in ten years

I think the biggest difference ten years later and now is that I can do want I want ten years later instead of having to follow the guidelines given by my parents and teachers. Ten years later, I may be a boss in one company, or may be a programmer in famous company. Either way, I am doing what I want to do in the future. I will not be constricted to study, spending a lot of my time with these boring books and knowledges, but have access with more interesting things such as high technologies and new programs. I think it is only by doing what we like most can we truly gain happiness in our life.

### Favorate movies

The movie that I like most is called *Interstellar*, which tells a story about an astronaut travelling in the space to save the world. The reason I like is is two folds. First, I like to see movies that contain universe, I think it is really cool and the universe is full of unknown. The black holes, the gaint stars. These things really draw my eyes. Second, this movie tells me how great the love of a father can be. I still remember the famous dialogue - only love can travel through space and connect us together. I was touched by the astronaut's love toward his daughter. I think it is the best movie I have ever seen.
