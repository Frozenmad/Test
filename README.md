### Book influence you
*Talk about a book you have read that was important to you for some reason. Explain why the book was important to you. Give specific details and examples to explain your answer.*

The book that is of much importance to me is the **Wonderful Advantures of Nil**, which talks about a boy named Nil travelling around the world with gooses. This book is important to me because it is the first fairy tale I've read. I still remember that I stay up all night reading this book. It is also because Nil taught me a lot. He taught me that I need to stay calm while facing a problem. Along the journey travelling the world, Nil encountered a lot of dangerous situation, being chased by a wolf, for example. But instead of being nervious, Nils always stay calm and think how to get rid of it, and he always succeed eventually. His way of solving problem helps a lot when I sometimes run into real problems.

### television
*Some people believe that television has had a positive influence on society. Others believe it has had a negative influence on society. Which do you agree with and why? Use details and examples to explain your opinion.*

In my opinion, the television has a positive influence on society. The reason are tow folds. On one hand, it is a good way to kill time. Whenever you are tired or feel boring, you can turn on your television, switch to an insteresting programmme, and enjoy watching it. It makes our life more interesting. On the other hand, while you are killing your time, you can also get access to more information or news using TV. When I was young, I often watch a programme called **Exploring**, in which I learnt a lot of knowledge outside classroom. For example, the unknown questions in the world, the different kinds of weather and how they are formed, etc.

### GroupThink

Groupthink is a phenomenon that, when people make decisions as a group, they always make one that against his own will because of pressure, which is always bad or irrational. In the speaking, the professor use his company's experience to explain it. Once, he, his boss and coworker thought that an up-to-date looking will help selling their product, so they made a meeting about it. At first, more than half of the workers agree with him, until a senior professor said that they need to focus on technique, no the apperance. Suddenly almost all the workers changed their mind, including his coworker. So this idea was abandoned. At last, their competitors chose to focus on the apperance, which result a big loss to their company.

### Cars or Public transportations

Mary is a volunteer of the after school's elementary school, and they plan to have a trip recently. At the beginning, she want to borrow a van as a transportation. But there is no van available for her. There are two solutions. First, she can choose to borrow cars from her friend, but by doing so, she need to borrow and to look for another drivers. She can also choose to use public transportations, but by doing so, she will have trouble supervising the childrens. I prefer the second choice, because it is more efficient, and do not need to worry about drivers. I also think that supervising childrens will improve one's managing skills.

### Recommend city to a foreign friend

I would recommend my friend to the city of my university - Shang Hai. There are two main reasons. First, Shanghai is the most international city in my country. It has a lot of universities like mine, which consist of a considerable number of foreign students. Besides university, Shang Hai also have a lot of companies that have a lot of foreign workers. A more international city will provide a more pleasant atmosphere, in my point of view. Second, Shang Hai also has a plenty of places of interests. For example, the Shang Hai Bond, Tianzi Fang. There are also free libraries and parks for visitors to play around. It is really a good place to fufill one's life even for local people.

### Course cancellation

The school want to cancel the sculpture cources in art department because of the lack of student and the retirement of the only-one professor who teaches the cource. The woman thinks that is a bot loss towards the school. First, the lack of student is not a result of a lack of interests, but a lack of time. The students there have a lot of requirement. Their time is spend mostly on the struggling of meeting the requirements, so there is little time to choose a course like scupture class. Second, if the money matters, a part-time professor is a good choice, and there are a lot of teachers who has a second interested area, which includes sculptures. So the lack of teacher is not a problem
