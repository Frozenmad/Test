The book which is of much importance to me is the Wonderful Advantures of Nil, which talks about a little boy named Nil travelling around the world with gooses. This book is important to me because it is the first fairy tale book I've read. I still remember that I finished this book in one afternoon and night finding that it was 4 a'clock in the morning. It is also because Nil taught me a lot. He taught me that I need to stay calm facing a problem. Along the journey travelling the world, Nil confronts a lot of dangerous situation, being chased by a wolf, for example. But, everytime it is hazarduous, Nils always stay calm and think how to get rid of the danger, and he will always succeed eventually. His way to solving problem helps a lot when I sometimes run into real problems.
